Hello, I'm Sharon Zhang!

I'm a front-end web developer lived in Beijing, China, working with JavaScript.

I'm passionate about programming, design and user experience. I like building minimal websites using static site generators. I have made several minimal WordPress themes, Jekyll themes and Jekyll plugins. You can find them from my [Github](https://github.com/erlzhang).
